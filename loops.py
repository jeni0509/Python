#for loop is a counting loop
for i in range(5):

#the range will start from o to 10 it will go to 10-1=9 values each iteration i value will be incremented with lower limt 0 to upper limit 10 and have 9 values
for i in range(0,10):
    print(i)
#range (initial ,final,step)
#it will only print even numbers as we have step as 2 it will start from 0 leave 1 and go to 2 and leave 3 go to 4
for i in range(0,10,2):
    print(i)
#while loop will be keep on going
i=0
while i<10:
